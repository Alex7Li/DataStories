  "description": "Rating for about 61k different rated users of codeforces. Using the [API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp), I scraped all active users in dec 2022 and january 2023 (it took about a month to run the script). Thanks to the CF team for open with their data so that we can do interesting analysis!\n\nFor each user, you can view the last 10,000 submissions they have made to codeforces (usually, this is all of them) as well as the full history of contests they have participated in and their rating changes. Also, there is information about all the tags/difficulty for most of the problems.\n\nBy combining these timestamps, you can do some analysis on the best strategy to improve in competitions, what problems/tags are the most valuable to learn from, etc.\n\nSources of uncertainly: People don't always practice on codeforces. They can come in with varying level of experience, and they often do things on different sites at the same time as they practice on codeforces. Furthermore, there is no way to know how much time is spent thinking on problems or reading editorials.",
