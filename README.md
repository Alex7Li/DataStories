For the telling stories with data class.
## About Me
Hi! I'm Alex, in the MS Artificial Intellegence and Innovation program at CMU. This semester I wanna learn dataviz to be a datawiz :)
More information is at [my portfolio](https://alex7li.github.io/about).

## What I hope to learn
First and foremost, I wanna know how to look at a big dataset and figure out how to get valuable insights from it by using figures. To do that, I want to get comfortable creating data visualizations at the speed of an incredibly fast turtle! It seems like this class is really about the process of how to highlight that data, which is something I never really thought about. But yeah now that I think about it, I want to learn that too.

## Portfolio
Currently it's empty!
