For the telling stories with data class.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Alex, in the MS Artificial Intellegence and Innovation program at CMU. This semester I wanna learn dataviz to be a datawiz :)
More information is at [my portfolio](https://alex7li.github.io/about).

## What I hope to learn

First and foremost, I wanna know how to look at a big dataset and figure out how to get valuable insights from it by using figures. To do that, I want to get comfortable creating data visualizations at the speed of an incredibly fast turtle! It seems like this class is really about the process of how to highlight that data, which is something I never really thought about. But yeah now that I think about it, I want to learn that too.

## Portfolio

Currently it's empty!

Prepare to beautiful charts like this

<script type='text/javascript'>
const divElement = document.getElementById('viz1675270390098');
const vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];
vizElement.style.width='100%';
vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';
const scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';
vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);

## Final Project

Possible stories (depends on data analysis)

Consistent practice outperforms practicing in short sprints?
When you feel like you aren't ever going to improve, keep going and you can expect to see results.
As a competitive programmer, I want to know the best practice schedule so that I can improve my rating. I can do this by [burst practice on one topic] [using certain tags] [consistent daily practice].

As a problem setter, I want to know the most common problem types so that I can make something people want to solve. I can do this by making problems with tags that create improvement.
