# Final Project

## Features Implemented from user research

- Make the text refering to a question mark refer to an information icon.
- Separate out pupil and newbie category
- Remove colors from the treemap
- Modify the rating vs n submissions to have an x-axis of number of correct submissions, and smooth out the lines.
- Add subtitles to remove text from the website
- Add discussion on limitations due to practice on other platforms.
- Modify some of the background to have more of a coding feel
- Split the linear model into all rating categories.

I did this, but the coefficients became pretty random. Maybe there were too many variables? I wasn't impressed by it, so will not include in the project.

- Take the last chart and either make a grid of correlation between variables instead of the existing chart, or change the title to be more clear

I tried making a grid of correlation values here. However, I don't know if it's that good since it's a bit confusing and there isn't that much information, it is fine to explain in text. I think I will stick with the existing chart.
